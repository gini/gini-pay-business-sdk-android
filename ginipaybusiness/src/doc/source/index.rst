Gini Pay Business SDK for Android
=================================

.. note:: **Deprecation Notice**

   The Gini Pay Business SDK for Android was replaced by the `Gini Health SDK
   <https://github.com/gini/gini-mobile-android/blob/main/health-sdk/>`_.

   This SDK won't be developed further and we kindly ask you to switch to the Gini Health SDK. Migration entails
   only a few steps which you can find in this `migration guide
   <https://github.com/gini/gini-mobile-android/blob/main/health-sdk/migrate-from-pay-business-sdk.md>`_.

Gini Pay provides an information extraction system for analyzing business invoices and
transfers them to the Android banking app, where the payment process will be completed.
The Gini Pay Business SDK for Android provides functionality to review the document and
its extractions and pay using a payment provider.
