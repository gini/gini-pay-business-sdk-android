<p>The Gini Pay Business SDK for Android was replaced by the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/gini/gini-mobile-android/blob/main/health-sdk/">Gini Health SDK</a>.</p>
<p class="last">This SDK won’t be developed further and we kindly ask you to switch to the Gini Health SDK. Migration entails

<p>Gini Pay provides an information extraction system for analyzing business invoices and
transfers them to the Android banking app, where the payment process will be completed.
The Gini Pay Business SDK for Android provides functionality to review the document and
its extractions and pay using a payment provider.</p>

<p>The entry point for Business SDK is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GiniBusiness</span></code> class which depends
on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Gini</span></code> (Gini Pay API lib) to interact with the backend.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Gini</span></code> class can be built either with client credentials (clientId and clientSecret)
or with a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SessionManager</span></code> if you have a token. For these two cases there are helper methods:</p>
<blockquote>

<h3>Flow<a class="headerlink" href="#flow" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>GiniBusiness is the main class for interacting with Gini Pay Business SDK.
It provides a way to submit a document for reviewing its extracted payment details and
let’s the user make the payment with one of the payment providers.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>The recommended flow is to:</dt>
<dd><ol class="first last arabic simple">
<li>Call <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GiniBusiness.checkRequirements()</span></code> to make sure that the flow can be completed.</li>
<li>Call one of the overloads of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">setDocumentForReview</span></code>, to submit a document.</li>

<div class="section" id="checking-requirements">
<h4>Checking requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#checking-requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Requirements are not enforced, but recommended. Review Fragment will still start, but
the flow cannot be completed if not all requirements are met.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">checkRequirements()</span></code> returns a list of missing requirements. Empty list means all requirements are met.</p>

<dd><ol class="first last arabic simple">
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Document</span></code> instance in the case the upload was performed with Gini Pay Api lib (see <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Gini</span></code> class).</li>
<li>Document id, this will probably be the case when there’s backend integration between the Business Client and Gini.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>When calling it with an id the SDK will make a network call to obtain a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Document</span></code> instance.
So it is preferred to use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Document</span></code> instance if you already have it.
The same applies to the optional <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PaymentDetails</span></code>, if they are present they will be displayed
and network calls to get extractions will be skipped.</p>
<p>The exposed flows of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GiniBussines</span></code> are used by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ReviewFragment</span></code> to observe the state of the document and extractions, but they are public
so that they can be observed anywhere, the main purpose for this is to observe errors.</p>
<p>Note: If you observe payment details flow, you can check PaymentDetails.isPayable as an extra condition before displaying the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ReviewFragment</span></code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="display-reviewfragment">
<h4>Display ReviewFragment<a class="headerlink" href="#display-reviewfragment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>ReviewFragment displays document pages and extractions and it lets the user pay using a payment provider</p>
<p>To instantiate it you need to create a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FragmentFactory</span></code> and set it to fragment manager:</p>
<div class="highlight-kotlin notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">ReviewFragmentFactory</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">private</span> <span class="k">val</span> <span class="py">giniBusiness</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">GiniBusiness</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">FragmentFactory</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>ReviewFragment handles errors by default, displaying snackbars for errors, but it
can be configured to ignore them, in which case all flows of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GiniBusiness</span></code> should
be observed for errors.</p>

<p>An example banking app is available in the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/gini/gini-pay-bank-sdk-android">Gini Pay Bank SDK’s</a>
repository called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">appscreenapi</span></code>.</p>

<p>In order to test using our example banking app you need to use development client credentials. This will make sure
the Gini Pay Business SDK uses a test payment provider which will open our example banking app.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="end-to-end-testing">
<h4>End to end testing<a class="headerlink" href="#end-to-end-testing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>After you’ve set the client credentials in the example banking app and installed it on your device you can run your app
and verify that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GiniBusiness.checkRequirements()</span></code> returns an empty list.</p>
<p>Following the <a class="reference external" href="flow.html">flow guide</a> show the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ReviewFragment</span></code> after analyzing a document.</p>
<p>Check that the extractions and the document preview are shown and then press the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Pay</span></code> button:</p>

<p>After you press the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Pay</span></code> button the Gini Pay Bank SDK resolves the payment and allows you to return to your app:</p>

<p>With these steps completed you have verified that your app, the Gini Pay API, the Gini Pay Business SDK and the Gini Pay
Bank SDK work together correctly.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="testing-in-production">
<h4>Testing in production<a class="headerlink" href="#testing-in-production" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The steps are the same but instead of the development client credentials you will need to use production client
credentials. This will make sure the Gini Pay Business SDK receives real payment providers which open real banking apps.</p>
<p>You will also need to install a banking app which uses the Gini Pay Bank SDK. Please contact us in case you don’t know
which banking app(s) to install.</p>
<p>Lastly make sure that for production you register the scheme we provided you for deep linking and you are not using

   &quot;Licensor&quot; shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
   the copyright owner that is granting the License.

   &quot;Legal Entity&quot; shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
   other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
   control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
   &quot;control&quot; means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
   direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
   otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
   outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

   &quot;You&quot; (or &quot;Your&quot;) shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
   exercising permissions granted by this License.

   &quot;Source&quot; form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
   including but not limited to software source code, documentation
   source, and configuration files.

   &quot;Object&quot; form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
   transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
   not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
   and conversions to other media types.

   &quot;Work&quot; shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

   &quot;Derivative Works&quot; shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

   &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including
   the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
   to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
   submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
   or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
   the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, &quot;submitted&quot;
   means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
   and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
   Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
   excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
   designated in writing by the copyright owner as &quot;Not a Contribution.&quot;

   &quot;Contributor&quot; shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
   subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
   meet the following conditions:

   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
       stating that You changed the files; and

   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
       the Derivative Works; and

   (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
       as modifying the License.

   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
   the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
